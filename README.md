## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my second Front End Mentor challenge.

The most challenging part of this assignment was getting the desktop view image to take up exactly half of the card. 

- I learnt that you can use `overflow: hidden;` on the parent container to hide any small overlows.

- I then found it easier to make the `width` and `height` of the `image container` and `information container` exactly the same, then simply use flexbox, with flex direction set to row. This resulted in both the two halves being exactly half.


### Continued development

- Continue doing Front-End Mentor Challenges
- Get better at planning how to approach a problem
- Be able to see differences between mobile and desktop and understand how that will influence the structure of the HTML.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs CSS Overflow example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) - I refered to this to help my understanding of `overflow`.
